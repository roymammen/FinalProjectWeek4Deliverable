# FinalProjectWeek4Deliverable
Outline of the project : 
  Gobal warming is an issue which may affect our very existance if we do not holistically find a solution to. Based on several city temperature data available and using key datasets available on Air Quality indicator, and populaiton growth, this project intends to establish future temperature change predictions

  As a final step the project was able establish a strong co-relation with temperature trends, which is contributing to global climate change. Factors like population growth and green house gasesappear to contribute advrsely into overall rise in temperature at least looking at data from Los Angeles.

ML model using Random Fores Regressor to predict temperature is having a score of 0.79!

For future development: In addition to adding more relevant data to existing data set in works, the final intent of this project initiaiton is to add more cities and get a good co-relation of city temperature with Global average temperature variation. As features going forward, ML model can be developed to learn the average Global temperature variation, and to establish what portion cities contribute to in the overall average.
